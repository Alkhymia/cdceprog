# cdceprog #

This is a very quick hack for programming a TI CDCE925 PLL chip with
settings generated by TI's ClockPro software on a Linux system.

## Usage ##

    cdceprog.py settings.hex

The settings.hex file must be generated using the `File->Save Intel Hex
File` menu entry of ClockPro. The script assumes that the PLL is
connected to I2C bus 1 and uses its default address (0x64). If your
settings change that address, programming will likely fail. After
programming, the settings are committed to the chip's EEPROM.

## Raspberry Pi notes ##

This script was written to program a [Dual Frequency
Oscillator](http://nfggames.com/forum2/index.php?topic=5744.0)
connected to a Raspberry Pi. It assumes that you do not have one of
the extremely ancient Raspberry Pi boards that had I2C bus 0 on the
GPIO header - if you do, change the line `bus = smbus.SMBus(1)` to
`bus = smbus.SMBus(0)` in `cdceprog.py`.

You must be running Raspbian on your Pi and install the additional
package `python-smbus` for the script to work. Since accessing the I2C
bus directly usually requires root privileges, you will likely want to
run the script with sudo, e.g. `sudo ./cdceprog.py settings.hex`.

To connect the DFO to the Raspberry Pi, check the nice overview of the
GPIO connector [here](http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout). The programming
pins on the side of the DFO must be connected as follows:

* DFO `SDA` to RasPi pin 3
* DFO `SCL` to RasPi pin 5
* DFO `GND` to RasPi pin 6

Additionally, you need to decide how to power the DFO board while it
is being programmed. If the board has already been installed in the
target system, just turn on the target system.

If the DFO has not been installed in the target system yet, you can
power it from the Raspberry Pi. To do this, connect the DFO pin `+5V`
to the RasPi pin 2. *Do not* make this connection if the DFO is
powered from a target system!
